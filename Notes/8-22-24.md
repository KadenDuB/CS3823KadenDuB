# Introduction to Theory of Computation
Three central areas of the Theory of Computation
- Automata
- Computablility
- Complexity

Central Question: 
What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?

*"Starting from the end you can better understand the reason for the beginning"* -Sipser

## Complexity Theory
Computer problems can be easy or hard
- Sort a list of numbers: Easy
- Schedule classes satisfying certain constraints (best scheule?): Hard

What makes some problems computationally harder and others easy?
(We don't know the answer)

- There is an elegant scheme for classifying problems according to their computational difficulty
- Usually we want to solve problem easily, but hard to solve problems can also be handy(e.g. for cryptography)

Certain problems cannot be solved by computers!

*"Is a mathematical statement true or false?"*
- Need to classify problems as solvable or not

## Sets and Languages
- Definitions of a set
- Operations on sets (union, intersection, complement)
- Formal languages an their properties
